# StableDiffTextToImage
Stable Diffusion Python App with Tkinter

Welcome to the Stable Diffusion Python App repository! This project demonstrates a use case of Stable Diffusion models for text-to-image generation on your local machine with just a CPU.

In this project, we utilize the Hugging Face model hub to directly access a Stable Diffusion model and create a simple desktop application built with Tkinter. This allows us to generate images from text prompts directly on your computer without needing high-end hardware. 

To improve time used in generation of images, pass in GPU as device instead of CPU in app.py (if your device has GPU).

Project based on Nicholas Renotte's 6th Episode of CodeThat!
